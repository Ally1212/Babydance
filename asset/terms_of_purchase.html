        <h1>Peekababy Terms of Purchase</h1>
        <p><span class="important">Last updated:</span> 26 May 2025</p>
        <p>
            These Terms of Purchase ("Terms") govern your purchase and use of subscriptions for Peekababy's premium
            features ("Services"). By purchasing a subscription, you agree to these Terms.
        </p>

        <h2>Subscription Services</h2>
        <p>
            We offer various subscription plans (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly). When you subscribe, you get access to
            premium features for the duration of your chosen plan.
        </p>
        <p><span class="important">
                Your subscription will automatically renew at the end of each subscription period unless you cancel it.
            </span></p>

        <h2>Payment and Renewal</h2>
        <p>
            Payment will be charged to your Apple ID account at the confirmation of purchase. Your account will be
            charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can manage and cancel your subscriptions by going to your account settings on the App Store after
            purchase. To avoid being charged for the next period, you must cancel your subscription at least 24 hours
            before the end of the current period.
        </p>

        <h2>Free Trial</h2>
        <p>
            We may offer a free trial period for our subscriptions. If you subscribe to a plan with a free trial, you
            will not be charged until the trial period ends. At the end of the free trial, your subscription will
            automatically convert to a paid subscription and your Apple ID account will be charged, unless you cancel at
            least 24 hours before the trial ends.
        </p>

        <h2>Price and Term Changes</h2>
        <p>
            We reserve the right to change the subscription prices and terms. We will provide you with reasonable notice
            of any price changes before the new prices take effect. If you do not agree to the price change, you may
            cancel your subscription before the change goes into effect.
        </p>

        <h2>Refund Policy</h2>
        <p>
            All purchases are final. As per Apple's policy, we do not offer refunds for subscriptions purchased through
            the App Store. If you have issues with a purchase, please contact Apple Support.
        </p>
